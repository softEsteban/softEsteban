### Hi. Read code, commit or chill exploring these repos! ☕👽


- 💻 I'm really into TypeScript, C#, JavaScript, Python and SQL
- 💬 I like creating formal and complex systems with PostgreSQL and more creative ones with MongoDB
- ⚡ Building with Angular feels just fine!
- 🤖 Fun fact: I'd like to create a great programming language, model or system
- 🐱 Why is Nestjs so nice??
- 🌱 I love nature and mountains!
- 🐳 I'm doing my best to learn Docker
- 🙆 When I craft software and learn new technologies, I try to keep it as closer to the user as posible.
  At the end they will make our software mature, grow and improve.

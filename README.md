### Let me tell you something!

> When you study philosophy, time flies as you catch up with everything you want to learn, just like when you learn to code and explore new stacks or brilliant tools. In philosophy, you define concepts, build systems, and discover coherent logic, much like crafting software. In philosophy, you may feel foolish or regal at times, just as a developer does. 🧠
